# JavaScript-Game
Module 4
Press 'Start' button in the upper left side of screen to start playing a JavaScript Quiz.
View High Scores and Reload the page are a few of the other options. 
Just click on the answer that seems correct and you will know in real time if it was right or not.
After you finish 5 questions, if there is still time on the clock, you will be asked to enter initials for High Score tracking.
If time runs out, don't worry, reload the page and try again.
Too many wrong questions will also subtract time.
Have fun! And good luck!
